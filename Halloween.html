    <p>Halloween is celebrated annually in Western culture on October 31. The name comes from “All Hallows’ Eve,” meaning the night before the feast honoring all saints. Today, Halloween has become a joyful global event rather than only a religious ceremony.</p>

    <p>The festival likely began with the Celts in Ireland. Their new year started on November 1, celebrating Samhain, the god of death. On October 31, they believed spirits returned to the human world and tried to possess the living.</p>
    <p>To protect themselves, people hid in the darkness, avoided fire, and dressed like ghosts so spirits would not notice them. This tradition spread and evolved into modern Halloween.</p>

  <!-- SECTION 4 -->
  <section>
    <p>The carved pumpkin symbol comes from the legend of Jack O’Lantern, a trickster who trapped a demon in a tree. When he died, neither heaven nor hell accepted him. The demon gave him burning coal to light his way in the cold dark. Jack placed it in a hollowed turnip.</p>
    <p>This became the pumpkin lantern tradition. People carve pumpkins and place lights inside to scare away evil spirits during Halloween.</p>
